  <h1>In the Garden - Wawa Li (2025)</h1>

<b><i>When unearthing the footnotes</i></b>

Another day in the archives, to remember ourselves through archival processes, to situate ourselves within a lineage. In the steps of Once more with our hands in

 amongst others — looking for Her (1), then looking for ourselves. In hegemonic mysticism where bodies shapeshifts into

humble bodies are recorded through a language of criminality.

And then, after a day in

I hit the same streets again heading home—streets I playfully recognized earlier in the archive. My hands feel dirty, my head foggy—ripples of collateral winds blown from battles they waged onto somewhere East.

<b><i>When living in the footnotes</i></b>
<br>
<br>
In the empire of Death, a new threat is always being declared
<br>
Tomorrow, they say, the Mounted Knights will ride through our streets, ready to register more people. Today again, we are targeted—gazed at by a dark force, armed with gun and batons or policies disguised as spells of safety. Demonized, pursued under expansive definitions of 
<select>
  <option value="interference">interference, </option>
  <option value="terrorism">terrorism, </option>
  <option value="espionage">espionage, </option>
</select>
we are accused of practicing so-called magic. In renewed hysteria, streamed across public space — from Parliament Hill to the Wild West Web, we bear no weight under such proclamations.
The technologies used to consume their fictions may have evolved, but our experience repeats with such precision that it feels karmic—a tale as old as the system that manufactured it. E-pidermalized across conversions, our material bodies rendered into online replicas—bodies remain weaponized. Can’t escape. Across networks are intergenerational hauntings—from my family, to my people, to each new iteration of the web.

In the imperialist fiction that reconstructs our lives,

search for us in the footnotes. In the garden where we build our own records, we carry in humble mysticism the story of a collective lineage of witches who survived their historical hunts — a perpetual tragedy.

  <option>surveillance</option>

From centuries of Humiliation, to lived-streamed or ongoing genocide of all natives — we carry lives as humble as our means.

<b><i>When drafting the footnotes</i></b>

Call me sensitive—for I’ve grown used to those critics of my mother’s. 
<br>
From being labeled a threat to national security to her concerns for my own sanity — in truth, there’s barely a difference. Caught between emotional affect or turning into another piece of sensitive information, we operate under affective law when the legal system fails its duty to deliver justice. I’m not coping, I am obsessed with justice in a devotion matched to reciprocate that of the empire’s obsession with repression.
