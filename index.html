Another day in the archives, to remember ourselves through archival processes, to situate ourselves within a lineage. Once more with our hands in

amongst other documents — looking for <i>Her</i> (1), then looking for ourselves. In hegemonic mysticism where bodies shapeshifts into

I hit the same streets again heading home—streets I playfully recognized earlier in the archive. My hands feel dirty, my head foggy—ripples of collateral winds blown from battles they waged onto somewhere East.

<b><i>When living in the footnotes</i></b>
<br>
<br>
In the empire of Death, a new threat is always being declared.
<br>
Tomorrow, they say, the Mounted Knights will ride through our streets, ready to register more people. Today again, we are targeted—gazed at by a dark force, armed with gun and batons or policies disguised as spells of safety. Demonized, pursued under expansive definitions of 
<select>
  <option value="interference">interference, </option>
  <option value="terrorism">terrorism, </option>
  <option value="espionage">espionage, </option>
</select>
we are accused of practicing so-called magic. In renewed hysteria, streamed across public space — from Parliament Hill to the Wild West Web, we bear no weight under such proclamations.
The technologies used to consume their fictions may have evolved, but our experience repeats with such precision that it feels karmic — a tale as old as the system that manufactured it. E-pidermalized across conversions, our material bodies rendered into online replicas remain weaponized. Can’t escape. Across networks are intergenerational hauntings—from my family, to my people, to each new iteration of the web. 
<br>
<br>
In the imperialist fiction that reconstructs our lives,
<select>
  <option>the non-elite</option>
  <option> the criminalized </option>
  <option>the damned</option>
</select>
search for us in the footnotes. In the garden where we build our own records, we carry in humble mysticism the story of a collective lineage of witches who survived their historical hunts — a perpetual tragedy of perpetrated 
<select>
  <option>displacement</option>
  <option>surveillance</option>
  <option>famines</option>
  <option>wars</option>
</select>
. From centuries of humiliation to the live-streamed, ongoing genocide of Indigenous peoples for land extraction, we carry lives as humble as our means.

<b><i>When drafting the footnotes</i></b>
<br>
<br>
Call me sensitive—for I’ve grown used to those critics of my mother’s. 
<br>
From being labeled a threat to national security to her concerns for my own sanity — in truth, there’s barely a difference. Caught between emotional affect or turning into another piece of sensitive information, we operate under affective law when the legal system fails its duty to deliver justice. I’m not coping, I am simply commited to justice in a devotion matched to reciprocate that of the empire’s obsession with repression.

<i>Wawa's footnotes (unsorted) : </i>
  <br> - About the placeholders: (1) for those whose stories we look to carry through, (2) from a fiction where our bodies are interchangeable placeholders, (3) for the technologies we used to gather as third spaces or communication channels with our loved ones
  <br> - I situate many lot of my reflections on archives from my work with Alex Tigelaar, in the production of archives for the podcast <a href="https://www.noussommestoujoursla.com/">"Nous Sommes Toujours Là"</a>
  <br> - H. Steyerl, in the economy of the Poor image
  <br> - To the lives ruined in the war on terror waged on Canadian diasporas, fighting for justice
  <br> - Every accusation from the occupation is a confession: The irony of the British occupation that drugged our people on the Mainland with opium, while labeling Chinese-Canadians diasporas and sw'ers as opium smugglers in Montreal; to the allegation of terrorism to an empire funding genocide and war all over the world.
